<h1>Meetup & conference video equipment</h1>
<p>
  A little while ago we started getting over subscribed for the JavaScript group
  <a>Bristol JS</a>
  that I run. I wanted to give everybody who wanted the chance to watch the talks but we simply didn't have the capacity.
</p>
<p>
  Filming the talks is a great way to give these people a chance to do so whilst opening our content out to the wider community.
</p>
<p>
  We had some quite shoddy equipment to begin with which involved me filming the talks on my iPhone but when we started taking on <a href="http://bristoljs.org/#cwrap" target="_blank">sponsors</a> this year we decided to give this equipment  an overhaul.
</p>
<p>
  I was surprised to not find any information on what equipment was recommended. The closest thing I could find was
  <a>this blog post</a>
  from back in 2010. I decided that once I got all our gear sorted I'd write about it.
  You can view and subscribe to our videos on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPOICck6I3zqGveOs6aFT5A" target="_blank">Bristol JS channel</a>.
</p>
<p>
  So here it is, a comprehensive guide of the equipment we use and why we use it. If you have any questions you can email me on
  <a>adam@lab.io</a>

        <h2>Laptop</h2>
        <p>
          The setup allows for multiple screens to be connected and switched easily but is limited to devices with HDMI.
          Digital outputs like display port can also be supported with
          <a>adapters.</a>
        </p>
        <p>You can follow the dotted lines to see how all the equipment is connected.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id='video-equipment-section-2'>
      <div>
        <h2>HDMI Switch</h2>
        <p>
          The switch makes the handover to speakers seamless by pressing one button and does not interrupt video recording further down the line. We use the
          <a>Betron 3 Port HDMI Switch.</a>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id='video-equipment-section-3'>
      <div>
        <h2>HDMI Splitter</h2>
        <p>
          This is the secret sauce of having a good setup. Sometimes we go out to two screens making the splitter necessary without forcing the speaker to go into mirrored mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          The splitter however serves an additional purpose in that it strips DRM meaning your captures won't fail in the middle of the talk. We use
          <a>this one</a>
          from Portta.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Capture Device & Mic</h2>
        <p>
          Software capture is hard to organise, inconsistent and can slow down a machine that is already having a hard time running two screens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hooking up a capture device also means you can get a single recording of the whole night making editing much easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The
          <a></a>
          mic
          simply captures the speaker without much background noise
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id='video-equipment-section-5'>
      <div>
        <h2>Screen</h2>
        <p>
          You often don't have the control about where the content is displayed but if you do I'd highly recommend a TV for audiences up to 100 people and a high lumens projector for anything larger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most presenters will write there slides in 16:9 (1920 x 1080) these days so keep this in consideration and let your speakers know your setup early.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id='video-equipment-section-6'>
      <div>
        <h2>Camcorder</h2>
        <p>You could just record the screen but body language says so much. I'd recommend investing in a low to mid range camcorder to capture your talks speakers.</p>
        <p>The video quality should be good enough that it isn't distracting, battery life and quality of the microphone if far more important in my experience.</p>
        <p>
          We use a
          <a>Sony HDRPJ810</a>
          that I picked up on an Amazon lightning deal for just £399. It has built in memory but we use a
          <a>high speed SD card</a>
          so I don't have the take the camera with me when I'm editing.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id='video-equipment-section-7'>
      <div>
        <h2>Syncing</h2>
        <p>
          Great now you've got the content in a few places, you might have noticed that the audio has been captured in two places this is for two reasons.
        </p>
        <p>1. Synchronisation of the camcorder and capture device can be done automagicly with the audio.</p>
        <p>2. The capture device mic is great for picking up the speaker without background noise, but the camera mic is great capturing the audio during Q&A.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id='video-equipment-section-8'>
      <div>
        <h2>Final Cut Pro X</h2>
        <p>
          Editing is made super easy with
          <a>Final Cut Pro X.</a>
          Just make a multi-cam clip from your two sources, drop it into a project, open the multi-cam view and simply click the source you want shown whist watching back in real-time.
        </p>
        <p>Pro tip: If your tight for time you can do this at 2x speed using the timewarp feature.</p>
        <p>
          We use a
          <a>2TB external HDD</a>
          since most of these projects reach at least 20GB.
