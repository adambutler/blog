<h3>Bio</h3>

<p>I'm a web developer, hacker, creative coder and hyperactive man-child based in the beautiful city of Bristol.</p>

<p>I design and develop web applications for startups at Simpleweb. In my spare time, I like to hack away at hardware, building whatever inspires me both useful and useless. I am inspired by the intersection between art and science.</p>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Becoming a more efficient developer requires investment in the tools you consume, customise and build for yourself. Doing so allows you to maintain consistency throughout the lifespan of the project and free you and your team up to innovate on the important things.</p>

<p>In this talk we'll cover the importance of open-source, collaboration & documentation. We'll also cover how our community has benefited from from sharing tools, how we can contribute back to the community and why I've been inspired to build and share my own tools.</p>
