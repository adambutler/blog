I'm a 25 year old Full-stack Web Developer living in the beautiful city of Bristol. I spend my time
building Web Applications mostly in Ruby, AngularJS, SASS and CoffeeScript. I love contributing to
open-source projects and building my own tools.

I've been tinkering with web development for as long as I can remember and have been doing so
professionally for just over four years after completing a degree at Bath Spa University. I currently
hack away at an agency called Simpleweb where I've had the privilege to work on dozens of great
projects each with their own challenges across a broad range of software stacks.

Getting involved with the community is really important to me and for the last two years I have been
running the BristolJS group as well as speaking and helping out at various other events.

## Experience

#### February 2012 - Present / Web Developer at Simpleweb

Simpleweb has given me the unique opportunity to work across lots of different projects across many
different platforms, workflows and software stacks over various points of a products growth. It has put me
in a great position to have a broad knowledge to develop good decisions to fulfil both technical and
business requirements.

#### September 2010 - February 2012 / Web Designer at DUO

For a couple of years after leaving university I worked at a fashion brand called DUO. I learnt to
build a multilingual retail site crafted to the high quality that was expected of us. During a
rebrand I was tasked to develop the front-end. This still influences my workflow today and I believe
strongly in style-guides to manage technical debt and retain front-end consistency, flexibility and
robustness throughout the life of a product.


## Skills

As a full-stack developer the combination of my skills is my real strength. I started out as a front-end
developer but in my desire to build my own tools I've taught myself backend development mostly in the
form of Ruby-on-rails as well as server provisioning and product development.

Beyond this I've also had experience building a tablet game, lots of hardware projects, mobile apps, geolocation games,
proxies and browser extensions. This has given me a broad repository of knowledge that I can draw from regardless
of the challenge I face.
